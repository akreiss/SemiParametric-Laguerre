# SemiParametric-Laguerre
In this repository you can find the R-code which implements the semi-paramentric estimation methodolgy using Laguerre polynomials from a paper written by Ingrid Van Keilegom and myself. Details can be found in the file documentation.pdf in the repository. This pdf contains also more details about the functions provided in funcitons.R and in the example code in example.R.

If you find any mistakes in the code or have questions or comments, please feel free to share them with me. You can find my up-to-date contact details on the website which is linked to this repository.
